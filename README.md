# Premier League Football Predictor
Predict the outcome of English Premier League matches using machine learning.

# Description
This project utilizes cutting-edge machine learning techniques to accurately predict the results of Premier League (PL) matches. By analyzing extensive historical match data, including team performance metrics, venue statistics, and match timing, the model predicts whether a team will secure a win, suffer a defeat, or end in a draw in forthcoming matches.

# Data
I gathered the English Premier League dataset, spanning the 2020 to 2024 seasons. Utilizing web-scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup and Pandas, data was collected from the FBREF website.

# Process
1. Data Collection: Match data was scraped from FBREF to compile a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing: Pandas were used to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring its suitability for machine learning algorithms.

3. Model Training: The Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and accuracy, was applied to train the model on the dataset, enabling it to predict match outcomes effectively.

4. Improvements: Precision was enhanced through the incorporation of rolling averages, refining the model's predictive capabilities.

# Next Steps
Continuously update and refine the model as new data becomes available, ensuring its relevance and accuracy over time.
